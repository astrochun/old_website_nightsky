		  </div><!--close button_small-->
		  <p>Hello! My name is <b>Chun Ly</b>, and I'm currently a <a href="http://nasa.orau.org/postdoc/description/index.htm">NASA Postdoctoral Fellow</a>
		     at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC). My research is sponsored by
		     <a href="http://www.janerigby.net">Dr. Jane Rigby</a> and the Observational Cosmology Laboratory (Code 665). Previously, I was a Giacconi Fellow
		     at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>. I completed my Master's and Ph.D. in Astronomy at
		     University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), under <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~malkan/">Prof. Matthew Malkan</a>'s advisorship. Prior to
		     UCLA, I was at University of Arizona and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory where I worked on distant radio galaxies with Drs. Craig Walker,
		     David de Young, and Mike Brotherton, and Prof. Jill Bechtold. You can find my CV <a href="CV.pdf">here</a>.

		  <p>My current astronomical research aims to determine how galaxies, such as our own Milky Way, were formed and how they evolved over the past ten
		  billion years. My past work has characterized the stellar population in galaxies. I utilize different empirical techniques to identify star-forming
		  galaxies, and study their stellar and gaseous properties. You can learn more <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

		      <h3>December 8, 2014</h3>
		      <p>The proposal titled "Definitive Measurements of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at z~2.2" was
		      awarded three nights on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. I am the Science PI for the proposal with
		      Dr. Masao Hayashi as the PI.</p>

		      <h3>December 4, 2014</h3>
		      <p>My first-authored paper titled "Metal-poor, Strongly Star-Forming Galaxies in the DEEP2 Survey:
		      The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Temperature-based Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate"
		      was submitted as a Letter to the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>. You can read our results on the
		      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1834">arXiv</a>.</p>

		      <h3>December 1, 2014</h3>
		      <p>(1) My observing proposal titled "Definitive Measurements of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at
		      z=0.25-1" was awarded telescope time (one night) on the Keck 2 telescope and grant money ($16,000)
		      by the NASA Keck committee.
		      (2) Also, I am a co-investigator on another Keck observing program (PI: Matthew Malkan) titled
		      "Investigating Galaxy Evolution Processes with Gas Metallicity in Distant Starburst Galaxies" that was
		      granted two nights by the University of California committee.
		      Both programs will study low-mass galaxies and determine the properties of the interstellar gas. It will
		      ultimately investigate if there is a fundamental relationship between three derived physical properties
		      of star-forming galaxies.</p>

		      <h3>November 26, 2014</h3>
		      <p>A co-authored <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7391">paper</a> titled "A Critical Look at the
		      Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation in the Local Universe: Non-parametric Analysis Framework and Confounding
		      Systematics" was accepted for publication in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>. The paper examines the
		      local mass-metallicity-SFR relation and explains the conflicting results that is seen in previous studies.
		      It puts forth a non-parametric approach that provides a better examination of this relation, and presents
		      comprehensive re-analysis of previous work.</p>

		      <h3>October 30, 2014</h3>
		      <p>The <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1551">paper</a> "The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Gas
		      Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate for H&alpha;-selected Galaxies at z~0.8 from the NewH&alpha; Survey"
		      was accepted for publication in the <i>Astronomical Journal</i>. The paper is led by Mithi de los Reyes,
		      a third-year undergraduate student that I mentored during Summer 2013.</p>


		      <p></p>
		      <h3>October 9, 2014</h3>
		      <p>My NASA Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) research proposal titled "Investigating the Evolution
		      of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at z < 1.6 with Deep GALEX and Spitzer Imaging" is approved after
		      competitive peer-review!</p>

		      <p></p>
		      <h3>December 17, 2013</h3>
		      <p>A lead-authored paper titled "'Direct' Gas-phase Metallicities, Stellar Properties, and Local Environments
		      of Emission-line Galaxies at Redshifts below 0.90" was published in the
		      <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/780/2/122/"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></a>. The paper
		      characterizes a rare population of galaxies that we found in the Subaru Deep Field. These galaxies are thought
		      to exist in large numbers during the first few billion years after the Big Bang. Because of observational
		      limitations, we can only find them seven billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
