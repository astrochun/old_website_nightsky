    was accepted for publication in the
    <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/805/1/45/meta"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></a>.
    The free copy of the paper can be retrieved from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1834">arXiv</a>.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>April 25, 2015</h3>
    <p>I participated in NASA's Hubble 25th Anniversary Family Day Event at the
    <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/udvar-hazy-center/">Smithsonian's National Air And Space Museum
    (Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center)</a> in Chantilly, Virgina.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>April 20, 2015</h3>
    <p>A co-authored paper titled "Physical conditions of the interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies at z~1.5"
    was accepted for publication in the <a href="http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/5/80"><i>Publications
    of the Astronomical Society of Japan</i></a>. The free copy of the paper can be retrieved from the
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05589">arXiv</a>.<br>


    <h3>December 8, 2014</h3>
    <p>(1) A co-authored paper titled "A Critical Look at the Mass-Metallicity-Star Formation Rate Relation in
    the Local Universe. I. An Improved Analysis Framework and Confounding Systematics" was published in the
    <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/797/2/126/"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></a>. The paper examines the
    local mass-metallicity-SFR relation and explains the conflicting results that is seen in previous studies.
    It puts forth a non-parametric approach that provides a better examination of this relation, and presents
    comprehensive re-analysis of previous work. The free copy of the paper can be retrieved from the
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7391">arXiv</a>.<br>

    (2) The proposal titled "Definitive Measurements of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at z~2.2" was
    awarded three nights on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. I am the Science PI for the proposal with
    Dr. Masao Hayashi (National Astronomical Observatory Japan) as the PI.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>December 1, 2014</h3>
    <p>(1) My observing proposal titled "Definitive Measurements of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at
    z=0.25-1" was awarded telescope time (one night) on the Keck 2 telescope and grant funding ($16,000)
    by the NASA Keck committee.<br>
    (2) Also, I am a co-investigator on another Keck observing program (PI: Matthew Malkan) titled
    "Investigating Galaxy Evolution Processes with Gas Metallicity in Distant Starburst Galaxies" that was
    granted two nights by the University of California committee.
    Both programs will study low-mass galaxies and determine the properties of the interstellar gas. It will
    ultimately investigate if there is a fundamental relationship between three derived physical properties
    of star-forming galaxies.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>October 30, 2014</h3>
    <p>The paper "The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Gas Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate for
    H&alpha;-selected Galaxies at z~0.8 from the NewH&alpha; Survey" was accepted for publication in the
    <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/149/2/79/meta"><i>Astronomical Journal</i></a>.
    The paper is led by Mithi de los Reyes, a third-year undergraduate student that I mentored during Summer 2013.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>October 9, 2014</h3>
    <p>My NASA Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) research proposal titled "Investigating the Evolution
    of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at z < 1.6 with Deep GALEX and Spitzer Imaging" is approved after
    competitive peer-review!</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>December 17, 2013</h3>
    <p>A lead-authored paper titled "'Direct' Gas-phase Metallicities, Stellar Properties, and Local Environments
    of Emission-line Galaxies at Redshifts below 0.90" was published in the
    <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/780/2/122/"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></a>. The paper
    characterizes a rare population of galaxies that we found in the Subaru Deep Field. These galaxies are thought
    to exist in large numbers during the first few billion years after the Big Bang. Because of observational
    limitations, we can only find them seven billion years after the Big Bang.</p>


    <h3>December 1, 2013</h3>
    <p>(1) My observing proposal titled "Definitive Measurements of the Mass-Metallicity-SFR Relation at

    by the NASA Keck committee.<br>
    (2) Also, I am a co-investigator on another Keck observing program (PI: Matthew Malkan) titled
    "Investigating Galaxy Evolution Processes with Gas Metallicity in Distant Starburst Galaxies" that was
