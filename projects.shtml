	      <h2>Star Formation and Chemical Enrichment across Time</h2>
	      <p>
	      A key question in galaxy formation is how do the connected processes of
	      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation">star formation</a>,
	      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics)">gas accretion</a>,
	      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">feedback from supernova</a>, and
	      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Interstellar_impact">metal enrichment</a>
	      transform galaxies across cosmic time? Answering this question requires extensive
	      observations that measure the star formation rate, stellar population, and gas-phase
	      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity">metallicity</a> of star-forming galaxies.

	      I am leading or co-leading four independent emission-line studies in the Subaru Deep Field
	      (<a href="http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/6/1011.full">Kashikawa et al. 2004</a>,
	       <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/657/2/738/">Ly et al. 2007</a>),
	      the NewH&alpha; Survey (<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/735/2/91/">Ly et al. 2011</a>,
	      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0017">Lee et al. 2012</a>), and the
	      <a href="http://deep.ps.uci.edu/">DEEP2 Survey</a>.  These studies utilize diagnostic
	      spectroscopy to characterize the physical properties and state of the ionized gas in galaxies.<br></p>

	      <h3>I. The Subaru Deep Field</h3>
	      <p>The <a href="http://subarutelescope.org/">Subaru</a> 8.2-meter telescope has stared for over 30 nights at
	      one particular region of the northern sky with one of the most sensitive optical imagers in the world,
	      <a href="http://www.naoj.org/Introduction/instrument/SCam.html">Suprime-Cam</a>.
	      This camera enables images to be taken over a large part of the sky that is comparable to the angular extent
	      of the Moon. The large area allows us to look at <u>hundreds of thousands of galaxies</u> simultaneously.
	      Why stare for so long? <font color="brown">To identify some of the faintest galaxies in the early universe!</font> To do
	      so, the survey utilized a technique called "<a href="http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/advimnarrow.aspx">narrowband imaging</a>"
	      to pick up emission from hydrogen and oxygen gases that reside within galaxies.<br>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the MMT, Keck, and Subaru observatories, my collaborators and I have
	      targeted some of these faint galaxies with optical and near-infrared spectrographs. We found a rare population of galaxies that
	      are rapidly forming at an unexpected rate. Many of these galaxies show signs of interactions with other nearby
	      galaxies (see below). We believe that these interactions trigger the extreme bursts of star formation that we
	      see. With detections of a very weak line, [OIII]&lambda;4363, we were able to determine that these galaxies
	      do not have significant heavy elements. In fact, a few of our galaxies have the most metal pristine gas seen
	      for galaxies outside the local Universe. I am trying to understand why these galaxies have so few metals. One
	      interpretation is that these galaxy interactions can drive new metal pristine gas into the galaxies, making it
	      appear "metal-poor" and fueling recent star formation. You can find more information in our
	      <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/780/2/122/">paper</a>.

	      <!-- <h3>II. The NewH&alpha; Survey</h3>
	      <p>Similar to the Subaru Deep Field, the NewH&alpha; Survey utilizes the narrowband technique to find high
	      redshift galaxies. The survey detects the H&alpha; emission, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region">
	      a recombination line emitted from the ionizing radiation produced by short-lived massive stars</a>.
	      With two custom narrowband infrared filters, we are able detect H&alpha; at z~1--2, during the epoch where
	      the global star formation peaked. We use two large-format infrared detectors called
	      <a href="http://www.noao.edu/ets/newfirm/">NEWFIRM</a> and
	      <a href="http://instrumentation.obs.carnegiescience.edu/FourStar/">FourStar</a> on the
	      <a href="http://www.noao.edu/kpno/">KPNO</a>/<a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/">CTIO</a> and
	      <a href="https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/Magellan">Magellan</a> telescopes, respectively. The survey is complete;
	      it has identified ~400 z=0.8 galaxies (<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/735/2/91/">Ly et al. 2011</a>),
	      and is projected to identify ~500 z=2.2 galaxies.<br>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the
	      <a href="http://www.lco.cl/telescopes-information/magellan/instruments/imacs/">IMACS</a> optical spectrograph on
	      Magellan, we targeted ~300 z=0.8 galaxies, and determined gas-phase oxygen abundances using "strong-line"
	      metallicity diagnostics.</p>

	      <h2>Academia, Mentorship, and Educational Outreach</h2>

	      <p> I have had the fortunate opportunity to teach, mentor, and participate in public outreach. While I was a
	      graduate student at UCLA, I led discussion sections and lab classes for introductory astronomy classes to both
	      non-science and science major students.<br>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade, I have mentored five undergraduate students on
	      astronomical research projects. Nearly all of them had no prior research experience and limited computer
	      programming skills. Through daily in-person interactions, I helped guide my students through the entire
	      scientific research process. I taught my students to inquire, to code, to analyze and interpret data, and
	      how to search and review scientific literature. These skills have helped my students in their current
	      pursuits. One of my students has completed her M.Sc. in Applied Science and later worked for the Lawrence
	      Berkeley National Laboratory. Another is pursuing a Ph.D in Astronomy at Yale. My most recent student has
	      her first scientific paper accepted for publication in the <i>Astronomical Journal</i>.<br>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have participated in Project ASTRO, an NSF-funded program to enrich
	      K-12 physical science education by giving students the opportunity to learn and interact with professional and
	      amateur astronomers. My experiences as a mentor have prepared me to actively engage undergraduate students
	      in leading scientific research.</p>
